# ost-to-pst
Converts outlook data file OST to outlook data file PST

# Usage

```ostConverter.exe <input .ost file> <output .pst file>```
> Example: ```ostConverter.exe C:\Users\username\Desktop\coolFile.ost C:\Users\username\Desktop\evenCoolerFile.pst

# Source Code
You can't use the regular `Aspose.Email` Nu-Get package, as the one used here is modified to make it usable without a license

## Other Stuff
Don't question the code itself, it's just an exploit thing because I didn't want to pay for this kind of service.

This is obviously free, and there is no license or whatever.
